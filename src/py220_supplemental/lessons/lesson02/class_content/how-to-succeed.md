# How to get the most out of this class

My opinion from experience:

"Pressure to do assignments, and complete them successfully with highly rated 
code, only serves to have students focus on getting 'good' grades".

We need to learn Python.

Collaboration, sharing, discussion, understanding the thought process are most 
important.

Here's what we do:
1. In class, I go over material that helps with the assignment, or is of
   general interest.
1. Students work on assignments in groups of 2, at most 3.
1. Use comments to show who did what.   
1. If you are stuck or things are unclear, try to resolve it yourself.
1. But if an answer isn't forthcoming in (say) 30 mins, let us know.
1. Don't spend more than 5-6 hours on any one assignment (unless you want to!)   
1. To be successful, understand the concept at least. Don't worry if
   you cant make the code work.
1. We will help 1-1 if needed or by scheduling an office hours for the topic.
1. 2 weeks after the topic is covered, we will go through the assignment in 
   class. One or two students can demonstrate their assignment. Together we
   will discuss the code and if / how it can be improved.
1. We will give feedback and explain any concepts that were misunderstood.   
1. After this we will share a "model answer".
1. You will not / can not understand everything on this class.
1. You will learn and improve if you try the assignments and get something
   / anything working.
1. Be sure to use comments to record gaps in your solution and any 
   areas where you are confused.
1. You will not fail this class by submitting 'imperfect' / incomplete 
   assignments.
1. You will know early on if you are at risk of failing. This is 
    the time at which we can do something about it!!!
