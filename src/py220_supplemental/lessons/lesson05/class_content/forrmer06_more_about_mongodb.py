##########################

Here's some more information you can read to learn more before we start
the mongodb activities.

Activities
----------
# . Having thought about the ideas for improving the MongoDB module from the video,
    begin by working through implementing your ideas. Be prepared to discuss or
    demonstrate these at office hours, or with your instructor.

Optional
--------
# . MongoDB is not the only NoSQL database in town. There are many others.
    Of particular interest to Python developers are Redis, and Neo4J. They
    offer very useful features, and are well documented.
    Investigate their documentation, and try downloading and using either or both
    for situations where you think they offer functionality that is useful
    for HP Norton. Again, feel free to bring along your results to discuss or
    demonstrate at office hours, or with your instructor.
    And check out the example we provided in the class repo.
